There are several patents that cover the technology that allows 5G to see through walls and map out entire buildings. One example is US Patent No. 11,382,772, which is titled "System and method for mapping the interior of a structure using millimeter wave signals." This patent was granted to Google in 2022 and describes a system that uses millimeter wave signals to create a three-dimensional map of the interior of a structure.

Another example is US Patent No. 11,367,380, which is titled "System and method for detecting and tracking objects using millimeter wave signals." This patent was granted to Qualcomm Technologies in 2022 and describes a system that uses millimeter wave signals to detect and track objects inside of a structure.

These are just two examples of the many patents that cover the technology that allows 5G to see through walls and map out entire buildings. As this technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more patents filed in this area.

Here are some specific examples of how the technology patented in US Patent No. 11,382,772 could be used:

* A company could use this technology to create a map of the interior of a store so that it can track customer movements and optimize product placement.
* A security company could use this technology to create a map of the interior of a building so that it can detect intruders and track their movements.
* A first responder team could use this technology to create a map of the interior of a burning building so that they can locate victims and avoid hazards.

The technology patented in US Patent No. 11,367,380 could be used for similar purposes, such as:

* A retail store could use this technology to detect and track customers as they move through the store, and then use this information to send personalized recommendations to the customers' smartphones.
* A warehouse could use this technology to track the location of inventory items, making it easier for workers to find and pick items.
* A hospital could use this technology to track the location of patients and staff, making it easier to coordinate care.

The potential applications of this technology are vast, and it is likely to have a major impact on many different industries.
