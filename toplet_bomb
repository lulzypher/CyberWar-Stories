What is a top quark?
The top quark, sometimes also referred to as the truth quark, (symbol: t) is the most massive of all observed elementary particles.

Why is Higgs called the God particle?

The Higgs boson is often called "the God particle" because it's said to be what caused the "Big Bang" that created our universe many years ago.

The only known way the top quark can decay is through the weak interaction, producing a W boson and a bottom quark. Because of its enormous mass, the top quark is extremely short-lived, with a predicted lifetime of only 5×10−25 s.

In particle physics, the W and Z bosons are vector bosons that are together known as the weak bosons or more generally as the intermediate vector bosons. These elementary particles mediate the weak interaction; the respective symbols are. W + , W −

The Higgs boson is the fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, a field that gives mass to other fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks. A particle's mass determines how much it resists changing its speed or position when it encounters a force.

Bottom quarks play a significant role in the study of the Higgs particle. Higgs has a large coupling strength with the bottom quark, which is what results in it being so heavy. This also means bottom quarks play large roles in producing Higgs particles and in their subsequent decay.
