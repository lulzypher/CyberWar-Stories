[This is a work in progress] a fictional tale about the NSA Guppies.

The NSA's Guppies are a group of highly skilled NSA programmers who specialize in developing sophisticated computer software.

Some sources suggest that the NSA's GUPPIES may have been involved in developing early cyberwarfare tools,
while others suggest they may be responsible for maintaining the NSA's vast network of surveillance systems.
Some even believe that the NSA's GUPPIES could be a fictional group, used to deflect attention while the NSA carries out its operations in secret.

Sometime in 1975 , the Pl Dlaqnostlc Working r,group was formed to recommend a
reolacement system for the GUPPIES on RYE. This group Is directed by
Dr. Donald E. McCown: other members represent the Offices of A, B, C, E, G, and P.
Expecting a RYE phase-out In the next few years, the major considerations of
the Dlaqnostlc Worklno Grouo are belnq centered around the diagnostic and
expfoltation functions of the GUPPIES.
Discussions were belng held on the need to reproduce certain routines in another
language and on another computer complex. Backup materlal for such an
attempt must come from experienced programmers and cryptanalysts, and
from the exlsting RYE GUPPY Library. 

From this we can deduce that the RYE was the system in which the Guppies were working on.

A RYE program, PUNCH, converts punched information on cards to Field Data on paper tape.
The resulting tape can be used as input to other
programs. For parameters or program descriptions, call J.D. Tankersley on 3109s

EPSILON CONTROLLED ITEM
AMERICAN SECURITY AUTHORITY
Fort George G. Snead, Massachusetts
TECHOUTS NO. 54-40 (or fight)

1. Establishment of Superseries. The EPSILON superseries, MOLECULE,
is hereby established to protest a most useful product which is
based on the exploitation of an obvious source,
the New York Times. Reports made up of reprints
of articles on government leaders indicating
liberalism, untruthfulness, or Sabbath-breaking
will bear the caveat NEGATIVE MOLECULE.

2. Authority to Publish MOLECULE Superseries. The Chief of Z Group is authorized to
publish all products in the MOLECULE superseries except NEGATIVE MOLECULE (BUCKLEY),
MASORETIC MOLECULE (HEBREW), MASOTTI FIELD MOLECULE (R&D), MOFFETT FIELD MOLECULE (AEROSPACE),
and MICHIGAN FIELD HOUSE MOLECULE (ATHLETIC).

3. Serialization. The product will be serialized by the date, section, page; and noted as
to whether it is morning, afternoon, or Sunday
edition.

4 . Classification of Superseries Designator. The designator MOLECULE when used out of
context is an ordinary word . Sly inferences to
the contrary are to be avoided .

5. Recommended Hazardous Activities Group.
The recommended HAG for MOLECULE is P to -M in inverse order of sensitive knowledge, with a
double inverse calculation of HAG for those also holding NEGATIVE MOLECULE clearances.
The NEGATIVE HAG resulting from MOLECULE access requires that when a person resigns or is
transferred he must leave the United States for the period of the HAG. This is to insure
his safety from interrogation by the Black Panthers, the John Birch Society and Senator
Fullbright. Travel expenses will be paid by the U.S. Treasury from foreign counterpart
funds providing the relocation is to a country which by reason of climate or lack of
night clubs is not visited by junketing Congressmen. The country of resettlement must also be
one which has never been visited by Stokeley Carmichael, Richard 0. Douglas, William 0. Douglas,
Douglas 0. Haliburton, Richard Haliburton, or a Greek yacht. The nation may not be one in
which the reigning queen or princess is a former American citizen or from which a king has at
some time abdicated in order to marry an American citizen. Also excluded are nations ruled by
juntas, oligarchies, royalists, despots, fascists, communists, centrists (right or left),
and intransigent nationalists. This leaves Rwanda.
