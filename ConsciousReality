Elliptic curves over Q

The observer effect shows consciousness plays a roll in our creating our realities.

The CIA has even released the gateway project talking about this.

Many people don't understand the full war of what is taking place with all the psyops and distractions in today's world.

With so many psychological ops being ran today we can understand why those running them wish to control what we believe and why those in control use censorship as a means of control.

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

I believe this verse here is speaking of the spiritual conscious control these rulers have.

They want to control the narrative, so they can stay in power by keeping us confused and feeling hopeless.

People constantly ask themselves "What is it that we are being distracted from?"
I believe this is it. They want us arguing over everything so that they can implement their of control by silencing those speaking out against them in order to control the consciousness reality we live in.

Explaining this idea in math terms.

This is hard to understand even for me, but when reading these terms it may be helpful to understand that what I'm seeing here is how this math relates to a plane or plane(s) of consciousness that create our world through elliptical curves(conscious energy).

An elliptic curve is an abelian variety – that is, it has a group law defined algebraically, with respect to which it is an abelian group.

In mathematics, an abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written. That is, the group operation is commutative. With addition as an operation, the integers and the real numbers form abelian groups, and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples.

The concept of an abelian group underlies many fundamental algebraic structures, such as fields, rings, vector spaces, and algebras. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood and fully classified.

Non-abelian groups
In mathematics, and specifically in group theory, a non-abelian group, sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group (G, ∗) in which there exists at least one pair of elements a and b of G, such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a. This class of groups contrasts with the abelian groups. (In an abelian group, all pairs of group elements commute).

Non-abelian groups are pervasive in mathematics and physics. One of the simplest examples of a non-abelian group is the dihedral group of order 6. It is the smallest finite non-abelian group. A common example from physics is the rotation group SO(3) in three dimensions (for example, rotating something 90 degrees along one axis and then 90 degrees along a different axis is not the same as doing them in reverse order).

Both discrete groups and continuous groups may be non-abelian. Most of the interesting Lie groups are non-abelian, and these play an important role in gauge theory.

a Lie group is a group that is also a differentiable manifold. A manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space, whereas groups define the abstract concept of a binary operation along with the additional properties it must have to be thought of as a "transformation" in the abstract sense, for instance multiplication and the taking of inverses (division), or equivalently, the concept of addition and the taking of inverses (subtraction). Combining these two ideas, one obtains a continuous group where multiplying points and their inverses are continuous. If the multiplication and taking of inverses are smooth (differentiable) as well, one obtains a Lie group.

In mathematics, a differentiable function of one real variable is a function whose derivative exists at each point in its domain. In other words, the graph of a differentiable function has a non-vertical tangent line at each interior point in its domain.

How to tell if a function is differentiable
A function can be proved differentiable if its left-hand limit is equal to the right-hand limit and the derivative exists at each interior point of the domain.

What I'm understanding and trying to convey here in these last two paragraphs is that in a debate or argument like for example "flat earth vs round" each point of the discussion carries it's counterpoint. The left hand limit is equal to its right.
However for a person who is only perceiving points in it's domain relative to it's biases their conscious reality will be skewed to only the information points they are willing to accept.
